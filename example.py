#Data Analysis Flow

#Import APIs/CSV with prior hash rate history by country and market (3 years)

#Clean data and createdData frames with rates of change (daily/monthly)

#High level statistical summaries with variance / stdev

#Plot data to visualize country overlay of hash rates (PyViz)

#Perform monte carlo simulations for prediction of future hash rates (initial investments  = energy?)
